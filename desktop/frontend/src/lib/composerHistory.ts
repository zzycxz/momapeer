// composerHistory is a tiny ring buffer of the user's last sent prompts with

// to bound localStorage, and deduped to keep the most recent occurrence of any
// repeated prompt at the top (mirroring the .bash_history "HISTCONTROL=
// erasedups" convention).

// navigation is the common case and is the smallest useful addition.
