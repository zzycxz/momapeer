// agent legitimately needs to read /etc, system headers, ~/.gitconfig, etc.),
// but it means the workspace boundary is a write boundary, NOT a read/data-
// isolation boundary. Do not assume "confined to workspace" implies read
// isolation when reasoning about security; bash + read_file can still exfiltrate
