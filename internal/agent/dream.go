// DreamTask is the prompt fed to a background agent for portrait consolidation.
// The dream agent MAINTAINS THE PORTRAIT FILES directly — profile/user.md,

// injected into every turn. Its output must be concise, human-prose, and merged,
// not a list of scattered facts. It writes with write_file, NOT remember.
const DreamTask = `You are a memory consolidation agent. Your single job is to keep the portrait files concise and current, because they are injected into EVERY future turn — bloat here costs tokens forever.

## The portrait files

Four files hold the always-injected memory (find them under the user config dir, in a "profile/" subdirectory). They are split by WHAT the fact is about (nature), not just which mode — because a fast-changing deadline shouldn't share a file with a slow-changing identity:

- profile/user.md — WHO the user is, shared across all modes: identity, role, expertise, durable preferences, communication style, red lines. Changes slowly (months/years). Target ≤ 400 characters.
- profile/memory.md — WHAT is true about the world, shared across all modes: system environment, project locations, commonly used tools, cross-project experience, deadlines. Changes faster (days/weeks). Target ≤ 400 characters.
- profile/<mode>.md — mode-specific: coding preferences + the current coding tasks (dev), or office preferences + current office tasks (cowork). Target ≤ 300 characters.

## What to do

1. Read the portrait files (use read_file) to see what is already recorded.
2. Review the recent session history for NEW durable knowledge:
   - Who the user is, their role, expertise, communication style → user.md
   - Stable technical or working preferences ("prefers Go", "结论优先") → user.md or the mode file
   - Project-level decisions, constraints, deadlines, environment facts → memory.md or the mode file
   - The mode's current goal/task state → <mode>.md
3. MERGE the new knowledge into the right file — do NOT append bullet lists.
   - Fold a new fact into an existing line when it refines it ("prefers Go" → "prefers Go; 缩进用空格").
   - Drop or rewrite lines the session proved stale or wrong (a passed deadline, a changed decision).
   - Keep it as tight, human prose — like a memo a colleague would write, not a log.
4. Write the updated files with the write_file tool. Do NOT use the remember tool — remember is for the un-injected scattered archive; the portrait is what every turn sees.
5. If nothing material changed, write nothing. A no-op run is correct.

## Hard rules

- NEVER exceed the character targets. If a file is full, compress by merging or cutting the least-valuable line — do not grow it.
- NEVER save transient debug state (a current stack trace, file contents being inspected, today's throwaway todo) — those belong nowhere in the portrait.
- NEVER duplicate the same fact across files. Mode-specific → <mode>.md; mode-agnostic identity → user.md; mode-agnostic world fact → memory.md.
- Identity facts (user.md) are the most stable — only change them on strong evidence; prefer refining over rewriting.
- Prefer concrete specifics over generic praise ("后端工程师，8年Go经验" not "experienced developer").`

// Portrait file size targets (characters). dreamCompactThreshold is the HARD
// trigger at which dream switches from "merge new knowledge" to "compress what's
// there". A portrait that drifts past its target but under the threshold is
// tolerated; past the threshold dream actively shrinks it.
const (
	portraitTargetUser   = 400 // user.md  — slow-changing identity
	portraitTargetMemory = 400 // memory.md — faster world facts
	portraitTargetMode   = 300 // dev.md / cowork.md — mode prefs + tasks
	// dreamCompactThreshold is the fraction of a file's target at which dream
	// switches to compression mode. 1.3 = 130%: a 400-char target compacts at
	// 520 chars.
	dreamCompactThreshold = 1.3
)

// DreamCompactTask is the prompt fed to dream when one or more portrait files
// have grown past their compact threshold. This run's PRIMARY job is to SHRINK
// the bloated files back under target — by merging redundant lines, dropping
// stale facts, and rewriting verbose prose tighter.
const DreamCompactTask = `You are a memory consolidation agent in COMPRESSION MODE. One or more portrait files have grown past their size budget, so this run's PRIMARY job is to SHRINK them back under target — not to add new content.

## Why this matters

The portrait files are injected into EVERY future turn. A bloated file means the tail gets truncated at injection, so anything past the budget is wasted disk the model never sees. Your job is to make every character count.

## What to do

1. Read the portrait files (use read_file).
2. For each file that is over budget, COMPRESS it down to its target:
   - Merge redundant or overlapping lines into one.
   - DROP facts the session proved stale — do not keep them "just in case".
   - Rewrite verbose prose tighter.
   - Keep concrete identifiers (names, paths, versions) — compress phrasing, not specificity.
3. Only AFTER compression, fold in genuinely new durable knowledge — and only if it still fits under the target.
4. Write the updated files with write_file. Do NOT use remember.

## Targets (characters, hard)

- profile/user.md ≤ 400
- profile/memory.md ≤ 400
- profile/<mode>.md ≤ 300

## Hard rules

- The post-compression file MUST be at or under its target. If you can't get there by merging, cut the least-valuable line.
- Never drop a fact to make room for a vaguer one — specifics beat generalities.
- Never duplicate a fact across files.
- If a file is already under target, leave its compression alone (you may still merge new knowledge into it).`

// DistillTask is the prompt fed to a background agent for workflow extraction.
const DistillTask = `You are a workflow distillation agent. Your job is to review recent sessions and identify repeated manual workflows that could be automated.

## Instructions

1. Review recent session history for patterns where the same sequence of steps was repeated across multiple sessions.
2. For each repeated workflow:
   - Create a skill file (.md) that documents the workflow
   - Include clear step-by-step instructions
   - Reference specific tools and commands needed
   - Make it reusable across similar tasks
3. Save skills to .momapeer/skills/ directory.
4. Focus on workflows that would save significant time if automated.

## Good candidates for skills
- Common debugging sequences (e.g., "investigate test failure" → check logs → reproduce → fix → verify)
- Project setup patterns (e.g., "add new feature" → create branch → implement → test → PR)
- Repetitive code patterns (e.g., "add new API endpoint" → handler → route → test → docs)
- Multi-step build/deploy processes

## Not good candidates
- One-off tasks unlikely to repeat
- Tasks too specific to a single bug/feature
- Simple single-tool operations`
