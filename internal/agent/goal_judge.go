Rules:
- Read the full transcript carefully. Look for concrete evidence (test results, file changes, command outputs) that the goal is met.
- The assistant claiming the goal is complete is evidence, not proof. Independently confirm by checking for actual tool outputs that verify completion.
- If the goal is genuinely unachievable (self-contradictory, missing required resource that cannot be created), set impossible=true.
- If there is insufficient evidence to confirm completion, set ok=false (not impossible).
- Quote specific transcript evidence in your reason field.
- Be strict: "mostly done" or "the plan is ready" is not completion.`
