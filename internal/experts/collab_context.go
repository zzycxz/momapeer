package experts

// collab_context.go provides the context-layer transform for expert-collab
// messages. It is intentionally in the experts package (where the record type
// lives) rather than in the agent package, so the agent can call a single
// pure function without importing experts' types beyond this one hook.
//
// Usage: the agent's stream() builds the LLM request from session.Messages.
// Before handing them to the provider it calls CollabContextMessages(msgs),
// which returns a slice where every expert-collab tool message has its Content
// replaced by the record's synthesis-only summary. The stored session is
// untouched — this is a read-side projection only.

import (

// CollabContextMessages returns a copy of msgs in which every persisted
// expert-collab tool message (Name == ExpertCollabToolName) is rewritten so
// its Content carries only the synthesis summary instead of the full JSON
// transcript. Non-collab messages are returned unchanged. The input slice is
// not mutated.
//
// If a collab message's Content fails to parse as a record (corrupt JSON,
// missing marker), it is left intact — better to send a large-but-valid tool
// result than to drop or mangle it.
